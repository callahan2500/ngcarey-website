		<p>
			I'm a New York based data analyst and occasional entrepreneur focused on building a career at the intersection of tech, data, education, 
			and community-development. My longterm goal is to build tools & experiences that make it as easy as possible for anyone, anywhere to access the education, 
			community, and capital they need to reach their potential. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Professionally, I've had the privilege to work at both venture-backed startups, large national nonprofits, and pursue my own entrepreneurial projects. These 
			experiences have taught me a lot about applying my technical, product, data, and people skills to the product development process: from learning how to ask the right questions to working closely with stakeholders to deploy products. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I'm a <b>Data Analyst</b> at <i><a href = "https://foratravel.com">Fora Travel</a></i> -- a startup <i><a href ="https://fortune.com/2025/04/24/fora-travel-thrive-series-c-60-million-recession/">redefining travel</a></i>. As Fora's first analyst, I've had the opportunity to work across multiple departments from growth to product and operations. Previously, I was the <b>Technical Lead</b> at <i><a href = "https://sprintfolio.com">Sprintfolio</a></i>, where I had the opportunity to grow my developer skills by building a learning platform. 
			I also had the chance to work with LLMs to build a learning co-pilot that helped our users answer questions, get feedback, and learn while working on real-world projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of work, I like to create educational content about math and science, improve my data science skills through research projects, and host dinner parties across NYC. I'm also into worldbuilding â€“ 
			since 2013, I've been writing about a world called Leatix and currently writing a fictional book about it.
